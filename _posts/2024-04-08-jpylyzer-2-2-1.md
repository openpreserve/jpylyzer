title: Jpylyzer 2.2.1 bugfix release
---
{% include JB/setup %}

We just released a first bugfix release for Jpylyzer 2.2. This fixes the following bugs in the 2.2.0 release:

* The check on the expected tile parts per tile (*foundExpectedNumberOfTileParts*) got broken at some point, which meant discrepancies between the expected and actual tile parts per tile would go unnoticed[^1].
* Jpylyzer would report an "unknown error" message if no *bPCSignValues* or *bPCDepthValues* could be read from the Bits Per Components Box. This would typically happen if this box was missing.

In addition, this release fixes a few packaging issues (thanks to Janne Pulkkinen for [the contribution](https://github.com/openpreserve/jpylyzer/pull/224)), and some problems with the unit tests.

Happy jpylyzing!
