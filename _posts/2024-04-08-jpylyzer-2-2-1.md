title: Jpylyzer 2.2.1 bugfix release
---
{% include JB/setup %}

We just released a first bugfix release for Jpylyzer 2.2. This fixes the following bugs in the 2.2.0 release:

* If *bPCSignValues* or *bPCDepthValues* were undefined, Jpylyzer would report an "unknown error" message.
* The check on the expected tile parts per tile (*foundExpectedNumberOfTileParts*) wasn't working the way it should, which meant discrepancies between the expected and actual tile parts per tile would go unnoticed.

In addition, this release fixes a few packaging issues (thanks to [Janne Pulkkinen](https://github.com/Matoking) for the contribution), and some problems with the unit tests.

Happy jpylyzing!
